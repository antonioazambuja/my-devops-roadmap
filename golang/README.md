Go is good and often preferred to build DevOps tools because of its effectiveness and built-in features: The simple statically written code, handy and fast tools, type safety that protects you from code bugs, a feel of the C language that most developers grew with, and the ecosystem of Go libraries consisting of everything needed to build (distributed) systems, developer tools, containerization applications and more.

Its suitability for distributed systems and networks is part of the reasons for adoption in creating DevOps tools. Go is just not too high or too low in level; it fits the perfect spot.
